# 🧪 SAP Ariba P2P Simulator

A Python-based simulation of an end-to-end **Procure-to-Pay (P2P)** process inspired by common SAP Ariba procurement workflows.

This lab is designed to demonstrate how a procurement transaction moves from a business requirement through purchase requisition, approval, purchase order, goods receipt, invoice reconciliation, and payment.

> **Important:** This is an educational simulation. It does not connect to a real SAP Ariba tenant, SAP Business Network, SAP ERP, or production system.

---

## 🎯 Objective

The purpose of this simulator is to convert SAP Ariba P2P concepts into executable Python logic.

Instead of only documenting:

```text
Purchase Requisition
        ↓
Purchase Order
        ↓
Goods Receipt
        ↓
Invoice
        ↓
Payment
```

the simulator models these stages using Python objects, validation rules, transaction data, and reconciliation logic.

# 🧩 Components

## 1. Purchase Requisition

Represents an internal request to purchase goods or services.

Example:

```json
{
    "requester": "Prateek",
    "material": "Laptop",
    "quantity": 5,
    "unit_price": 75000
}
```

---

## 2. Approval Engine

The simulator will apply simplified approval rules.

Example:

```text
Amount < ₹50,000
        ↓
Automatic approval

Amount ≥ ₹50,000
        ↓
Manager approval
```

The actual approval rules in a real SAP Ariba implementation depend on the organization's configuration.

---

## 3. Purchase Order

After approval, a purchase order is generated.

Example:

```json
{
    "po_number": "PO10001",
    "supplier": "Demo Supplier",
    "quantity": 5,
    "unit_price": 75000,
    "total": 375000
}
```

---

## 4. Goods Receipt

The simulator records how much of the ordered quantity was received.

Example:

```text
PO Quantity      = 100
Received Quantity = 95
```

This creates a potential reconciliation exception if the supplier invoices all 100 units.

---

## 5. Invoice

The supplier submits an invoice.

Example:

```json
{
    "invoice_number": "INV10001",
    "po_number": "PO10001",
    "quantity": 100,
    "unit_price": 75000
}
```

---

# 🔍 Invoice Reconciliation

The simulator will compare:

```text
Purchase Order
      +
Goods Receipt
      +
Invoice
```

Conceptually:

```text
             PO
             │
             │
        ┌────┴────┐
        │         │
        ▼         ▼
      Receipt   Invoice
        │         │
        └────┬────┘
             ▼
       Reconciliation
             │
       ┌─────┴─────┐
       │           │
      Match      Mismatch
       │           │
       ▼           ▼
    Payment     Exception
```

---

# 🚨 Example Exception

Suppose:

```text
PO quantity       = 100
Goods received    = 95
Invoice quantity  = 100
```

The simulator should identify:

```text
STATUS: EXCEPTION

Reason:
Invoice quantity exceeds received quantity.

PO Quantity: 100
Received: 95
Invoiced: 100
Difference: 5
```

This demonstrates how transaction data can be analyzed to identify procurement exceptions.

---

# 💳 Payment

Payment should only become eligible after the reconciliation process succeeds according to the simulator's configured rules.

Example:

```text
Invoice
   ↓
Reconciliation
   ↓
PASS
   ↓
Payment Eligible
```

If reconciliation fails:

```text
Invoice
   ↓
Reconciliation
   ↓
FAIL
   ↓
Exception
   ↓
Resolution
   ↓
Reconciliation
```

GR = 95
Invoice = 100

Expected:
EXCEPTION
```

GR = 100
Invoice = 95

Expected:
PASS / configured tolerance handling
```

### Scenario 4 — Invalid PO

```text

# 🎓 Learning Goal

This project is intentionally designed to bridge the gap between:

```text
SAP Ariba Theory
       ↓
Business Process
       ↓
Transaction Data
       ↓
Programming Logic
       ↓
Validation
       ↓
Exception Handling
       ↓
Integration Concepts
```

The goal is not to recreate SAP Ariba.

The goal is to **model the business logic behind an Ariba-style procurement process using software engineering concepts.**
